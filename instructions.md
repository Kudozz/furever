Tech stack: MERN stack

## task 1:[apptModel](backend/models/appointmentModel.js)
i completely changed the appt model by changing a lot of fields. thoroughly analyse the codebase and change the code to conform to the model. wherever the appointment model is being used, make sure the right arguments are being passed, correct input is being taken, etc. if needed modify the endpoints and controller. 


do not assume anything on your own, if you have any questions, ask me to clarify.
